        Several names were considered to direct this remake of Malayalam Porinju Mariam Jose. Writer Prasanna Kumar Bezawada, who was given the responsibility to work on the Telugu version, was strongly rumoured to be making his debut as a director with Naa Saami Ran. But the responsibility finally fell into the lap of choreographer Vijay Binni. The film marks his debut as a director. In an interesting combination, Allari Naresh and Raj Tharun will be seen as Nagarjuna’s friends in the movie. Nagarjuna has had many successful outings during the Sankranthi
        season. Will the magic repeat this time?Naa Saami Ranga narrates the story of an orphan Kishtayya (Nagarjuna), who comes to the village of Ambajipeta, and becomes a member of Anji’s (Allari Naresh) family. Kishtayya grows up to be a formidable youngster supporting the president of the village, Nasser, at every step. The story spans from the 1960s to the 90s, though the main events happen during the three Sankranthi festival days in 1988.
        Kishtayya falls in love with the village lender’s (Rao Ramesh) daughter, Varalakshmi (Ashika Ranganadh). Their affair is opposed by the lender strongly, and he commits suicide trying to prevent his daughter from leaving the house to marry Kishtayya. Guilty Varalu doesn’t marry Kishtayya, and they both remain single and lovers, pining and waiting, for each other most of their lives.

        The teaser of the upcoming Telugu movie, Yatra 2, headlined by Mammootty and Jiiva, was released by the makers today. Directed by Mahi V Raghav, the film is a sequel to the 2019 Mammootty-starrer Yatra
        
        While the first film was based on the life of the former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, the late YS Rajasekhara Reddy (played by Mammootty), the sequel tells the story of YS Jagan Mohan Reddy (Jiiva), the current Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.
        
        The teaser begins with an incident that shows Jagan the unimaginable support and goodwill that his father has earned over the years. Jagan takes over the party after the untimely death of his father and we then see glimpses of his political rivals conspiring to falsely accuse him of corruption. However, nothing seems to stop his uprising and the story, as we know already, will chart how Jagan became the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.
